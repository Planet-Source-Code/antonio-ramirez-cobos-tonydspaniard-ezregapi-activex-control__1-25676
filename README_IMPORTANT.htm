      as the association of specific file types, <b>do not work</b> on Windows
      NT or 2000. It can be easily changed, but I don't have the time to work
      more with this control [well, may be if it has any commercial use... let
      me know anyway at <a href="mailto:TonyDSpaniard@hotmail.com">TonyDSpaniard@hotmail.com</a>]</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="1">The EzRegAPI.chm help file included it is
      not complete nor free of ERRATA. I didn't had the time to update it yet,
      please forgive me and make sure you follow the examples on the test
      application. The rest of the features not documented on the help file,
      will have to be understood with your trial-and-error expertise [welcome to
      my world].</font>

    <td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><font face="Arial" size="1">My name is Antonio Ramirez
      Cobos and I am a self-educated programmer. I started to program about two
      years ago thanks to an interesting book on Java (that I could hardly
      understand) that fall into my hands during the studies of a Diploma in IT.
      For me all that programming syntax was just gibberish, that is, a
      challenge I could not resist.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="1">During these two years I successfully
      learned the following computer languages: JavaScript, VBScript, HTML,
      DHTML, VB (COM-ActiveX-API [still learning]-Desktop], SQL, and ASP. Yep, I
      could hardly take my eyes out the books. And even if my academic titles
      are not quite impressive I have achieved things I am proud of.</font>  <font face="Arial" size="1">Applications
      such as Virtual TimeSheet, IntranetPlus, Virtual
      Library Search Utility, Multiple-site-login system, Intranet Tutorials for
      JavaScript and SQL, Casual Staff Search Utility, EZNet, EzAssetRegister,&nbsp;
      and the EZSeries
      of ActiveX Controls [of course], are the positive side of my programming
      life [businesses are using these products and until the date, everything
      is just COOL].</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="1">The reason why I share with you this
      information as also, share with you my coding expertise, is no other but a
      way to thank all the other programmers that, before me, allowed me to
      learn from their code. There has been hard moments were the downloaded
      code was really bad to read and full of bugs, but I also thank those
      programmers because due to their mistakes, I successfully understood the
      process of the correct programming way. That's why, if you can improve my
      code in <b>any</b> way, or give me some suggestions, recommendations, or
      to report bugs, contact me at <a href="mailto:TonyDSpaniard@hotmail.com">TonyDSpaniard@hotmail.com</a>
      (do not use the e-mail address shown within EzRegAPI.chm help file, as
      it is not longer used by me).&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="1">In addition, I would like to say that I am
      not but a mediocre programmer when comparing myself with all that <b>guru</b>
      around the world. Nevertheless, I hope to maintain that feeling of '<b>don't
      know anything</b>' because that keeps strong my desire to learn and maintains my enthusiasm for programming. Be this last thought a push on your
      hard-learned programming experience. Be good and don't forget to vote for
      me on <a href="http://www.planetsourcecode.com">http://www.planetsourcecode.com</a>&nbsp;</font></p>
